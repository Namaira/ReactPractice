Webpack is set to send everything to port 3333. Go into npm and cd into React Practice.
Do all of the npm stuff (you probably know this better than I do -- npm install?), 
doing 'npm start' will utilize whatever file is named 'App.js' at the moment, 
though you can change which one you want to run in main.js.

All of the apps are commented. There are separate notes but they are not very 
comprehensive.
